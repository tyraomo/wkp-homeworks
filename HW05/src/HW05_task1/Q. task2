 1) What generally happens if an exception is thrown but not caught?
 -->
 If an exception is thrown but not caught, the program will terminate abnormally.
  The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) prints a stack trace that shows where the exception occurred, 
  but the program stops at the point the exception was thrown. 
  This makes debugging harder and can lead to crashes or incomplete processes, especially in larger systems.
  
 2) Discuss the advantage of catching specific exceptions (e.g., InvalidShippingInfoException)
 rather than just catching a general Exception.
 -->
 Catching specific exceptions allows the program to handle different error situations appropriately. 
 It makes the code easier to debug and maintain because you know exactly what went wrong and where. 
 In contrast, catching a general Exception can hide problems and make it unclear which part of the code failed, 
 leading to less precise error handling.
 
 3) Explain when a try with resources should be used an what its advantages are. (???)
 -->"A try-with-resources block should be used when working with classes that implement the AutoCloseable interface
  (like FileReader, BufferedReader, Scanner, Connection, etc.).
The advantage is that it automatically closes the resource after the block, even if an exception occurs. 
This helps prevent resource leaks (z.â€¯B. offene Dateien oder Datenbankverbindungen) and leads to cleaner, safer code."
